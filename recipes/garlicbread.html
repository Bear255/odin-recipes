    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        ½cup/8 tablespoons unsalted butter (1 stick), melted
        4fat garlic cloves, grated
        ½cup Parmesan, grated
        ¼cup firmly packed chopped flat-leaf parsley
        ¼teaspoon kosher salt
        Black pepper
        1baguette or rustic crusty loaf
        ½pound fresh mozzarella, thinly sliced (optional)
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        Step 1
        Heat the oven to 400 degrees. In a small bowl, stir together the butter, 
        <br> garlic, Parmesan and parsley. Add the salt and generously season with pepper. 
        <br> Set aside while you cut the baguette.
        
        Step 2    
        Cut deep slits into the baguette, 1-inch apart — don’t 
        <br> cut all the way through the loaf — and place the baguette on a large piece of foil. 
        <br> Using a teaspoon or an offset spatula, generously spread the seasoned butter inside each slit. 
        <br> Make sure to reach the bottom of the slit; don’t be shy here.
        
        Step 3
        Wrap the baguette in the foil, place on a baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes.
        <br> Remove the baguette from the oven and unwrap the top (leave the bread on the foil).
        <br> If you’re adding mozzarella, use the offset spatula or spoon to gently 
        <br> open each slit and tuck a piece of mozzarella in (it’s O.K. if the cheese pops out from the top a little).
        <br> Return bread to the oven and bake until crisp and golden on top, another 5 minutes.
        <br> Slice with a serrated knife (or tear with your hands) and serve at once.
    </ol>
