    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.
        Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.
        Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.
        Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.
        Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.
        Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.
        Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.
        Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it. 
    </ul>
